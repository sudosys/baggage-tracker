If your baggage has not been delivered to you upon arrival at your destination, proceed to the Lost and Found Office at the airport. This could be either the office of the airline you traveled with or the ground services company providing baggage handling services. Once you report your missing baggage, you will be issued a reference number, also known as a PIR (Property Irregularity Report) or Baggage Disruption Report number (e.g., ISTTK12345). This reference number is crucial for tracking the status of your missing baggage, so make sure to keep it safe along with your baggage tag and boarding pass. The baggage tag contains essential identification details, and having your copy ensures that your baggage can be accurately tracked and recovered.

Upon arriving at the office, ensure you scan any provided QR Code related to your case. This QR Code will streamline the tracking process by linking directly to the mobile application's tracking system, where you can receive real-time updates about the location and status of your baggage. It is important to note that if your baggage was handed over without a tag, identification might be more complex and could prolong the retrieval process. Always confirm that a copy of your baggage tag is handed to you during the check-in process. If your airline is part of the Star Alliance group, you can approach any member airline for assistance in tracking your baggage. Remember to report missing baggage immediately, as leaving the airport without logging an official claim may transfer full responsibility for any potential loss to you.
